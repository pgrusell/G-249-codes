# geo 

These macros creates a new .geo.root file **inside your R3B installation** that can be used in the simulations. Particularly, it creates the LH2 target, the FOOTs, whose positions are being read from the .dat setup file and finally the vacuum chamber (*_foot_only version does not create vacuum chamber).
