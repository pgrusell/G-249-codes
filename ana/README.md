Macros for the analysis of real or simulated data.

1. **sim2ana:** This macro translates the output of an R3B-based simulation (a .root file) into something useful. For the vertex reconstruction it has as output the coordinates of the 3d points measured in the FOOT as well as the real vertex. 

2. **reco:** Here we present different macros for vertex reconstruction from the FOOTs' info. Both analytical and NN-based algorithms are used. 

3. **analysis:** Macros for obtaining physical meaningful results.
