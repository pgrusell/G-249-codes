# exec 

Scripts for the fast execution of the different workflows. All intermediate files are going to be stored inside a /results folder.

1. **run_error(_vc).sh:** This script creates the geometry of the FOOTs and the LH2-target (in the _vc, also the vacuum chamber itself), then simulates the beam time, reconstructs the vertex **analytically** and study the error distribution of the reconstructed vertex in compare with the simulated vertex.
