# dependencies 

This file `python_dependencies.yml`, can be used to install all the Python requirements. To its use some kind of Conda installation is needed (particularly I recommend Miniconda, https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main). Once Conda is installed and activated just create the environment from the file as follows:

```bash
conda env create -f dependencies/python_dependencies.yml
```
